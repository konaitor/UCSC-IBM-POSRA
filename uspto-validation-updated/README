A large validation set consisting of 5719 chemical structure images and associated MOL files is available for download. This set was produced from the US Patent Office Complex Work Units and contain one structure per image, ground truth MOL files and a simple Perl script to benchmark the results of your chemical structure recognition software. The benchmark script takes two arguments - first the folder with ground truth files ("molfiles") and second with your generated files - the filenames of individual structures should be identical. It will compare the structures based on standard InChI. This validation set was made possible courtesy of collaboration with Dr. Steve Boyer and Dr. John Kinney.

Q: Where are the JAR files? 
A: At this point in time, the JSmol distribution does not include Jmol JAR files. 
   Those files are added in the Jmol project. See Jmol/dist/jsmol-java.zi_.
   
   We are currently in the process of designing an efficient work flow for 
   trusted signing of these applets.

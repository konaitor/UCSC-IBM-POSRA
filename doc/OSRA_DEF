# Definitions for OSRA #

Parenthesis will most likely be detected somewhere inside of find_atoms
inside of osra_structure.cpp. We will use potrace coordinates to detect
the structure of a line

osra.cpp
      main
            TCLAP - Super GetOpt
            osra_process_image - Where the magic Happens

osra_lib.cpp
      519 - osra_process_image  - Kind of a mess, couple hundred lines of no comments
            555 - Convert input to lowercase
            562 - Superatom ?
            586 - Load image with GraphicsMagick
            645 - Count pages of Input (PDF, PS)
            650 - Declare vectors to hold Images / Splices / Data
            673 - Loop through pages in document
            690 - Read image
            701 - Make image greyscale
            705 - Declare image / bond placeholder vectors
            712 - Scale image to desired resolution
            724 - Get background color
            734 - Get / Calculate image rotation
            738 - Unpaper (see unpaper.cpp) Deskews / Cleans scanned images
            745 - Find Segments (see osra_segment.cpp) Remove tables / text, leave diagrams (connected components)
            751 - Break up clusters (osra_segment.cpp) of diagrams into seperate boxes
            761 - Loop through each image at different resolutions (Maybe this is related to confidence)
            787 - Loop through each box at given resolution 
            798 - Create a blank image filled with bgColor the size of box n
            805 - Sample the original (entire) image and map pixel colors into box n
            813 - Rescale Box ?
            820 - See osra_thin.cpp, Thins binary image using Resenfeld's parallel thinning algorithm
                        (Possibly only thins straight lines)
            823 - Vectorize with potrace
            825 - Find atoms (see osra_structure.cpp) find vector curves / corners
            828 - Find chars (see osra_labels.cpp) Looks pretty intense
            833 - Find the average bond length
            829 - Find plus minus (see osra_labels.cpp) 
            831 - Find small bonds (see osra_structure.cpp)

osra_structure.cpp
      1259 - find_atoms - Use the potrace data to detect atom and eventually bond locations
            1267 - n is the number of contiguous segments potrace found
            1268 - tag is a pointer to segment's type (either corner or curve_to)
            1269 - c is a pointer to a list of control points see potrace lib
            1270 - n_atom is the current atom being parsed
            1271 - get the starting point
            1277 - atomize it (see struct atom_s in osra.h)
            1281 - add atom to the atom list
            1285 - continue to parse atoms and push them into our atom vector
                   and denote if it exists on a corner.  If it is not a corner
                   it is a bezier curve and the atoms exist along the control
                   points of the curve.
            1339 - Get the next curve in the list of potrace curves and do it all again
            1356 - Find the bonds (see find_bonds line 1204) note - 1 to 4 atoms have been pushed at this point

      1204 - find_bonds - determine if an atom exists at said location from recently pushed atoms
            1210 - start looking at the oldest, most recently pushed atom
            1215 - If the potrace curve was a corner an atom exists there
            1221 - If the direction changed between control points an atom exists there
            1227 - Calculate if current atom is farther from the last than the next, ?
            1239 - loop through the atoms, if an atom exists there than so does a bond!
            1247 - Create a bond (see struct bond_s osra.h) and push it to our vector of bonds

osra_labels.cpp
      655 - find_chars - Find associated atom names to atoms
            666 - Make sure that the curve does not overlap another
            671-678 - set starting position / bounds
            680 - For each potrace control point start with 0,0,width,height and start
                  narrowing down a box similar to the region near the respective 
                  control point.  We know somewhere in this area should exist an atom
                  character. The area is also described by max_font_width / height
            800 - Loop through pixels in this area testing for some discolored pixel
                  with respect to the background color.  This will clamp the box region
                  to the character. (get_pixel in osra_common.cpp, not much)
            839 - Read a character with get_atom_label (see osra_ocr.cpp) too intense
                  for now, but it parses a character.
            843-860 - Record letter position / information

osra_common.cpp
